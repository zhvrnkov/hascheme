* hascheme
My raw implementation of Scheme language interpreter written in Haskell and nicely guided by [[https://norvig.com/lispy.html][lispy]].

It's working in general but isn't useful yet and this probably will not be fixed.

To run you this you need haskell.

** WWD (What were done)
- parsing via parsec
- if expression
- define statement
- procedures call
- repl

** TBD (To be done)
- more operators to global_env
- quotation
- assignment (set!)
- lambdas
- floats
- tests

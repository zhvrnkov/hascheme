* hascheme
My raw implementation of Scheme language interpreter written in Haskell and nicely guided by [[https://norvig.com/lispy.html][lispy]].

It's working but doesn't do match yet and this probably will not be fixed.

To run you this you need haskell.

** TODO
- more operators to global_env
- quotation
- assignment (set!)
- lambdas
- floats
- tests
